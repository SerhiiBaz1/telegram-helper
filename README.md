I created a bot to facilitate the administration of hotel rooms, there are more Readme


I created a bot to facilitate the administration of hotel rooms.
I used modul:pyTelegramBotAPI
User1 clicks which room he wants to record 1-6, and record in JSON.file.
User2 clicks on the status and learns about rooms occupied, booked, free.
You can add as many rooms as you want.






if you like, you can donate me:5167803271761780

To find out User-id code:bot.reply_to(message,f'ID:{message.from_user.id}')

Thank you!
